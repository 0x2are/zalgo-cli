# zalgo-cli
A command line zalgo text generator.

I created this because I wanted to use a zalgo-text nickname on Discord. 
But the online generators that I found tended to generate text of a rediculous
lenght, or by making the length shorter the effect wouldn't look as good. There was
also the problem of having to generate it multiple times to find one that looked good.

This program solves both these issues. You can choose a maximum character limit, and the
program will evenly distribute the combining characters across the string. You can also
choose how many different strings to generate, so you can look through them and find
the one that you like the most.
